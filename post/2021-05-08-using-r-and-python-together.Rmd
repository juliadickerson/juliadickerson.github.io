There is a lot of debate on whether R studio or Python is better, but why not get the best of both worlds and use both together? 

Reticulate is a handy tool that can translate the data type from one environment to another environment for a different data type. For instance, R to python or vice versa. 

So let's get an example of reticulate at work!

here's how it works: 
You first download the library reticulate and then insert your code into an R chunk. 

```{R}
library(reticulate)

project<-"This is my project 3"
```

Then you go into a python chunck and get it to return the same code that you made in the R chunk. 

```{python}
project="blog post"
print(r.project,project)
```

And ta-da! I was able to combine information from R with information to python and get it as an output in python!

You can execute the same thing in an R chunk as well...

```{R}
cat(c(project,py$project))
```

And you get the same output, pretty cool!
